## :fire: Basic Setup:

Just clone the project and open it in Unity version 2022.3.7f1 LTS or newer, it should also run in any 2020+ version with no issues.
All the packages needed for the project will import automatically when opening it for the first time.

## :video_game: Controls
- **Movement**: WASD keys + Mouse look
- **Jump**: Spacebar
- **Attack**: Left Mouse Click or F key
- **Place/Break Blocks**: Right Mouse Click (place), Left Mouse Click (break)
- **Inventory**: I key to open/close inventory
- **Crafting**: C key to open/close crafting menu
- **Heal**: H key to use healing potion
- **Debug Commands**: F9-F12 keys for testing systems (see SystemTester.cs)

## :desktop_computer: Technical Architecture

### Procedural Generation System
The world generation system creates infinite, varied terrain using multiple noise layers:

> **3D Simplex Noise** â†’ **Depth-based Ore Distribution** â†’ **Block Data Generation** â†’ **Greedy Meshing** â†’ **Tree Generation** â†’ **Enemy Spawning**

- **Realistic Mining Progression**: Diamonds spawn deep (Y: 0-15), Coal near surface (Y: 20-45)
- **Biome Support**: Different noise parameters create terrain variation
- **Performance Optimized**: Unity Job System for multithreaded chunk generation
- **Memory Efficient**: 32x64x32 chunk system with automatic cleanup

### Combat & AI Architecture
The combat system features state-machine driven AI with physics integration:

```
Enemy AI: IDLE (wandering) â†’ CHASING (follow player) â†’ ATTACKING (damage + knockback)
```

- **Raycast-based Combat**: Accurate hit detection from camera center
- **Damage Calculation**: Weapon-specific multipliers (Stone Sword: 1.5x, Diamond: 3.0x)
- **Physics Knockback**: Impulse-based enemy displacement with stun effects
- **Health Management**: Player health system with potion healing integration

### Item & Crafting Systems
Advanced item management with automatic generation and recipe-based crafting:

**ItemDatabase Architecture**:
- **Auto-generated Block Items**: All voxel types automatically become craftable items
- **Equipment System**: Weapons with damage stats and equipment types
- **Dynamic Item Creation**: Missing crafting result items created at runtime
- **Thumbnail Assignment**: Automatic icon loading from sprite resources

**Crafting Implementation**:
- **Recipe Engine**: Ingredient validation with automatic UI updates
- **Dynamic UI Generation**: Crafting menu created at runtime with scroll support
- **Real-time Inventory Scanning**: Live ingredient availability checking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user feedback


### Data Persistence & Performance
Advanced save system with incremental loading and error recovery:

**Save System Architecture**:
- **Binary Chunk Serialization**: Compressed voxel data with WorldObject persistence
- **Incremental Saving**: Distance-based chunk management (max 5 chunks/frame)
- **Memory Management**: 18-27 chunk limit with automatic cleanup
- **Death Recovery**: Automatic save before returning to main menu
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from corrupted save files

**Performance Metrics**:
- **Target FPS**: 60+ at 1920x1080 resolution
- **Chunk Generation**: 5-20ms per chunk (multithreaded)
- **Memory per Chunk**: 50-200KB mesh data
- **World Size**: Virtually unlimited (2Â³Â¹ theoretical limit)
- **Render Distance**: 5-10 chunks (160-320 blocks)

### Advanced Inventory System
Enhanced inventory management with automatic item generation and visual feedback:
